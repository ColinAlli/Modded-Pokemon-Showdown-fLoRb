# Modded-Pokemon-Showdown-fLoRb
A modded version of "Pokemon Showdown", files taken from "Zarel's" Github. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKzk3eF-Wm8av1Qdd0GCEA YT = fLoRb
Also note that this will not be all game files just modded folders and what ever is modded. 




To Admins, If You Even Think About Adding This To The Game, Pleas Add It As A Hackmons. So If You Add It People Wont Complain About Pokemon Being Broken Or To Over-Powerd. Also If You Could Add It Feal Free To  Sugest Changes In Pokemon Or Just Random Stuff, I Would Be Happy To Change It. :)

#How To Install
This Feature Is Gimikey And There Is No "True" Tutorial.


#Why I Dont Add All Files
I Dont Add All Files Because I Dont Want To Screw Up The Real Game Because "index.json", This Is The File That Links To The Real Game And Its Possible I Can Make A Loop-Hole And Actualy "Hack" The Real Game!

#HELP 
When I Put "Dont Use This" I Mean Dont Use This File.

#Want To Sugest Files?
Then Just Tell Me On My Youtube Channel!


#Will You Have A Client?
Yes I Will, Its In Beta.


#IMPORTANT
Pleas Note That This Is An Old Project And Can Remain Untouched For Long Periods Of Time. This Project Is Tagged As Semi-Active
I Wont Be On This For Weeks At A Time At Some Points. What Im Saying Is This Was Forgotten For A While And I Will Try To Eddit 
It As Much As Possible. This Was Last Edited Probaly Like 3 Months Ago So Yeah You Get What Im Going After. EDIT I Last Updated The Actual Projest Almost 1 Year Ago XD
