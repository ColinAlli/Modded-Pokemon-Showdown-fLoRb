# Modded-Pokemon-Showdown-fLoRb
A modded version of "Pokemon Showdown", files taken from "Zarel's" Github. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKzk3eF-Wm8av1Qdd0GCEA YT = fLoRb
Also note that this will not be all game files just modded folders and what ever is modded. 




To Admins, If You Even Think About Adding This To The Game, Pleas Add It As A Hackmons. So If You Add It People OWnt Complain About Pokemon Being Broken Or To Over-Powerd. Also If You Could Add It Feal Free To  Sugest Changes In Pokemon Or Just Random Stuff, I Would Be Happy To Change It. :)

#How To Install
This Feature Is Gimikey And There Is No "True" Tutorial.
